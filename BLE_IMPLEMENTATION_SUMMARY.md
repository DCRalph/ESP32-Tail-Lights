#### 1. Ping Characteristic (`12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789001`)
- **Purpose**: Device status and basic information
- **Properties**: Read + Notify
- **Update Frequency**: Every 1000ms
- **Data**: Mode, enabled strips, device ID, battery level, uptime

#### 2. Mode Characteristic (`12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789002`)  
- **Purpose**: Application mode control
- **Properties**: Read + Write + Notify
- **Modes**: NORMAL (0), TEST (1), REMOTE (2), OFF (3)
- **Control**: Full application mode switching

#### 3. Effects Characteristic (`12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789003`)
- **Purpose**: Complete lighting effects control
- **Properties**: Read + Write + Notify
- **Features**: All effects in one consolidated characteristic
- **Control**: Indicators, headlights, taillights, special effects, colors

## Complete Handler Implementation

### Write Handlers ‚úÖ
The simplified characteristics have complete write handlers that:
- **Mode Handler**: Switches between application modes using proper enable methods
- **Effects Handler**: Controls all lighting effects through single consolidated interface
- Parse binary data structures correctly
- Apply settings to actual effect instances
- Handle input validation and error checking

### Read Handlers ‚úÖ
All characteristics have complete read handlers that:
- **Ping**: Provides real-time device status and system information
- **Mode**: Returns current application mode
- **Effects**: Returns complete current state of all lighting effects
- Query current state from effect instances
- Return real-time system status

### Data Preparation Methods ‚úÖ
All data preparation methods provide:
- **preparePingData()**: Live device status, strip states, system info
- **prepareModeData()**: Current application mode
- **prepareEffectsData()**: Complete effects state with all parameters
